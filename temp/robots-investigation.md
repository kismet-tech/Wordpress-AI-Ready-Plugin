# Robots.txt Investigation Log

## Baseline (WITHOUT Plugin) - 2025-06-04

### Content-Type Header from curl:

```bash
curl -I https://theknollcroft.com/robots.txt
```

**Result:** `content-type: text/html; charset=UTF-8`

### Actual Content from curl:

```bash
curl https://theknollcroft.com/robots.txt
```

**Result:**

```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /wp-admin/
Allow: /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php

Sitemap: https://theknollcroft.com/wp-sitemap.xml
```

### Browser Display:

- **Status:** Displays with proper line breaks ✅
- **Rendering:** Clean, formatted, readable

### Key Findings:

1. **WordPress serves robots.txt with `text/html` Content-Type** (not `text/plain`)
2. **BUT browsers still render line breaks properly** in baseline WordPress
3. **curl shows actual line breaks exist** in the server response
4. **WordPress's default robots.txt system works correctly** despite wrong Content-Type

### Hypothesis:

The issue is NOT WordPress's Content-Type headers. Something in our plugin is corrupting the formatting when we add content.

## WITH Plugin Installed - 2025-06-04

### Content-Type Header from curl:

```bash
curl -I https://theknollcroft.com/robots.txt
```

**Result:** `content-type: text/html; charset=UTF-8`

### Analysis:

❌ **Our header fix DID NOT WORK**

- Expected: `content-type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8`
- Actual: Still `content-type: text/html; charset=UTF-8`

### What This Means:

1. **Our `do_robotstxt` action hook is NOT running**
2. **OR headers are already sent before our function runs**
3. **OR another plugin/system is overriding our header**
4. **OR we're hooking into the wrong action**

### Next Steps:

- [ ] Check if our plugin functions are being called at all
- [ ] Check debug logs for our error messages
- [ ] Test content output (curl without -I flag)
- [ ] Verify plugin is actually active and loaded

---

## Investigation Steps:

- [x] Test WITH plugin installed - HEADERS
- [ ] Compare content before/after plugin
- [ ] Check debug logs from plugin
- [ ] Identify what our plugin is doing wrong

---

## Current Status: Header fix completely failed
