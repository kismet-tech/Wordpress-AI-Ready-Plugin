# Kismet AI Ready Plugin - Testing Framework

This testing framework provides a comprehensive, phased approach to validating the Kismet AI Ready Plugin before deployment to live WordPress sites.

## Testing Philosophy

**Never deploy untested code to production.** Our three-phase testing approach ensures your plugin works perfectly before it reaches your live site.

## Three Types of Testing

### üîß Prebuild Testing - Code Quality

**Purpose:** Code quality and standards compliance  
**Location:** `prebuild/`

[üìñ **Prebuild Testing Guide ‚Üí**](prebuild/README.md)

Validates your code before packaging or installation:

- PHP syntax validation
- WordPress Plugin Check compliance
- Coding standards verification
- File structure validation
- Security scanning

### üè† Local Testing - Avoiding Errors in Production

**Purpose:** Full functionality testing in safe environment  
**Location:** `local/`

[üìñ **Local Testing Guide ‚Üí**](local/README.md)

Tests complete plugin functionality without affecting your live site:

- Local WordPress environment setup
- Plugin installation and activation
- All endpoint functionality testing
- WordPress admin interface validation
- Performance and compatibility testing

### üåê Production Testing - Are Things Working?

**Purpose:** Live site validation and monitoring  
**Location:** `production/`

[üìñ **Production Testing Guide ‚Üí**](production/README.md)

Verifies everything works correctly on your live site:

- Live endpoint validation
- Performance monitoring
- Error tracking and debugging
- Production deployment verification

## Testing Sequence

Follow this order for complete validation:

```bash
# 1. Code quality validation
cd prebuild && ./validate-plugin.sh

# 2. Safe functionality testing
cd ../local && # Follow Local by Flywheel guide

# 3. Live site verification
cd ../production && ./test-endpoints.sh
```

## Why This Approach Works

### **Progressive Validation**

Each phase builds confidence for the next, catching different types of issues at the right time.

### **Risk Mitigation**

- **Prebuild** catches syntax errors before they break anything
- **Local** catches functionality issues before they affect visitors
- **Production** verifies everything works in the real environment

### **Professional Workflow**

Industry-standard development practices that ensure reliable deployments.

## Getting Started

1. **Start with prebuild** - catches code quality issues
2. **Move to local testing** - validates functionality safely
3. **Finish with production** - confirms live site compatibility

Each testing phase has its own detailed guide with step-by-step instructions and troubleshooting.

**Remember**: The goal is confidence. When your plugin passes all three testing phases, you can deploy knowing it will work perfectly.
