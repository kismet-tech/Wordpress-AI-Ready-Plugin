# LLMS.txt Endpoint

This endpoint provides the `/llms.txt` file for AI/LLM policy disclosure and MCP (Model Context Protocol) server discovery.

## Purpose

The LLMS.txt endpoint follows emerging conventions for:

- AI crawler discovery and policy disclosure
- MCP server announcements
- Usage guidelines for AI systems
- Contact information for AI-related inquiries

## Files

- `class-llms-txt-handler.php` - Main implementation using WordPress rewrite rules
- `class-llms-txt-handler-safe.php` - Bulletproof implementation with safety checks

## URL

- `/llms.txt` - Root level policy file (like robots.txt)

## File Format

The generated llms.txt follows this structure:

```
